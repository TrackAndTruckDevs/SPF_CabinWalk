A plugin for American Truck Simulator and Euro Truck Simulator 2 that allows you to unchain the camera from the driver's seat and freely walk around your truck's cabin. Explore your interior with smooth, animated camera movements.

### See It In Action

## Features

*   **Free Camera Movement**: Move the camera between the driver's seat, passenger seat, a standing position, and multiple spots on the sleeper sofa.
*   **Smooth Animations**: Enjoy configurable, fluid transitions between all camera positions.
*   **Interactive Walking Mode**: When in the standing position, you can:
    *   Walk forwards and backwards within a defined area of the cabin.
    *   Experience natural camera bobbing that simulates head movement.
    *   Crouch down or stand on your tiptoes to get a better look at your surroundings.
*   **Safety First**: A safety feature prevents you from leaving the driver's seat unless the truck is stationary and the parking brake is engaged.
*   **Live Configuration**: Interactively adjust camera positions, animation speeds, walking parameters, and more in real-time to perfectly suit any truck.
*   **Customizable Keybinds**: Configure all actions through the SPF Framework menu, with support for "Toggle" and "Hold" behaviors.
*   **Full Localization**: All text is translatable, with support for multiple languages.

*   **[Download the SPF-Framework here](https://github.com/TrackAndTruckDevs/SPF-Framework)**

### Steps

1.  If you haven't already, download and install the SPF Framework according to its instructions.
2.  Download the latest release of this plugin from the **[Releases](https://github.com/TrackAndTruckDevs/SPF_CabinWalk/releases)** page.

```

## How to Use

*   **Move to Standing Position / Walk**: `NUMPAD 2` (Tap to move, Hold to walk when standing)
*   **Cycle Sofa Positions**: `NUMPAD 1`

You can change these keybinds at any time in the "Key Binds" tab of the SPF menu.

### Configuration:

To adjust the plugin's behavior, go to the "Plugin Settings" tab, select **SPF_CabinWalk**, and explore the available options. You can configure:
